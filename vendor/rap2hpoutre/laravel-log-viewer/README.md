TL;DR
-----
The best (IMO) Log Viewer for Laravel 5 (compatible with 4.2 too). **Install with composer, create a route to `LogViewerController`**. No public assets, no vendor routes, works with and/or without log rotate. Inspired by Micheal Mand's [Laravel 4 log viewer](https://github.com/mikemand/logviewer) (works only with laravel 4.1)
